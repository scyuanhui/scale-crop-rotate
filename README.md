Scale, crop and rotate images, not blocking UI :unlock:
==========================================================================
```javascript
import scaleCropRotate, { imageDataToDataURL, URLToImageData } from 'scale-crop-rotate';

const progress = document.getElementsByTagName('progress')[0];

const resizeImage = async (imageURL, width, height) => {
  try {
    const data = await URLToImageData(imageURL);
    const resultData = await scaleCropRotate(data, width, height)
      .progress(value => {
        progress.value = value;
      });
    
    const image = new Image;
    image.src = imageDataToDataURL(resultData);
    document.body.append(image);
  }
  catch(e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
}

resizeImage(
  '/assets/beautiful-landscape.jpg',
  384, 
  190
);
```



UI unblock
----------
Image processing is an intensive CPU time consumption job. The data is processed in a very big loop inside the same [Event loop] iteration and, done in browser, may cause significant UI hickups. The solution may be to perform image processing in other thread with the help of the [WebWorker][WebWorkers]. However it is possible to avoid blocking the UI thread by performing the work in range of many Event loop iterations.

This function reserves 10ms of every Event loop iteration to process data.



Performance
-----------
This function uses the technique, proposed by [Paul Rouget] in his [article][1] about pixel manipulation with [Typed Arrays]. His method reduces the number of read/write operations to the [`ArrayBuffer`] of the [`ImageData`] returned by the [`CanvasRenderingContext2D.getImageData()`] method. It saves the overall processing time when iterating through every pixel in the image.

The usage of [`Math`] is avoided in favour of [Bitwise operators], giving a significant boost in performance in some browsers.

To save even more memory and time, scaling, cropping and rotating operations are performed in scope of the same loop.



Install
-------
```
npm i scale-crop-rotate
```
or
```
yarn add scale-crop-rotate
```



Syntax
------
```javascript
scaleCropRotate(source[, width, height[, cropX, cropY, cropWidth, cropHeight[, rotate[, enableSyncMode]]]]);
scaleCropRotate(source[, width, height[, rotate[, enableSyncMode]]]);
scaleCropRotate(source[, cropX, cropY, cropWidth, cropHeight[, rotate[, enableSyncMode]]]);
scaleCropRotate(source[, rotate[, enableSyncMode]]);
```

### Parameters

#### source
The source image data, should be an instance of the [`ImageData`].

#### width
A [`Number`] indicating width of the resulting image. If the value is `0`, the width is adapted to keep the same aspect ratio as in the source image.

#### height
A [`Number`] indicating height of the resulting image. If the value is `0`, the height is adapted to keep the same aspect ratio as in the source image.

#### cropX
A [`Number`] indicating distance from the left side of the source image to draw into the destination context. This allows to crop the source image from the left side. The default value is calculated to position the cropping area in center of the source image.

#### cropY
A [`Number`] indicating distance from the top side of the source image to draw into the destination context. This allows to crop the source image from the top side. The default value is calculated to position the cropping area in center of the source image.

#### cropWidth
A [`Number`] indicating the width of the area that will be transfered from the source image to the destination image. The default value is calculated to position the cropping area in center of the source image.

#### cropHeight
A [`Number`] indicating the height of the area that will be transfered from the source image to the destination image. The default value is calculated to position the cropping area in center of the source image.

#### rotate
A [`Number`] representing the [Exif Orientation Tag], or a [`DOMString`] containig one of predefined rotation values: `90deg`, `180deg`, `270deg`, `horizontal`, `vertical`. Last two predefined values allow to mirror image horizontally and vertically.

#### enableSyncMode
A [`Boolean`] switch forces function to work in syncronous mode. In this case funcion overall execution time is faster, but it blocks the UI.

### Return values
#### Async mode
A [`Promise`] that resolves with an [`ImageData`] containing the resulting image. A [`Promise`] is extended with the `.progress()` method that recieves a `function` as an argument to handle the image processing progress.

#### Sync mode
An [`ImageData`] containing the resulting image.



Helper functions

```javascript
scaleCropRotate.blobToImageData(object);
```

A [`Blob`] object to retrieve an [`ImageData`] from.
#### Return value
A [`Promise`] that resolves with an [`ImageData`].


### imageDataToBlob
Converts an [`ImageData`] to a [`Blob`] object.
#### Syntax
```javascript
scaleCropRotate.imageDataToBlob(object);
```
#### Parameters
##### object
An [`ImageData`] object to convert to a [`Blob`] object.
#### Return value
A [`Promise`] that resolves with a [`Blob`] object.


### imageDataToDataURL
Converts an [`ImageData`] to a [data URI] string.
#### Syntax
```javascript
scaleCropRotate.imageDataToDataURL(object);
```
#### Parameters
##### object
An [`ImageData`] object to convert to a [data URI].
#### Return value
A [`DOMString`] containing the processed [data URI].


### imageToImageData
Retrieves an [`ImageData`] from [`HTMLImageElement`] object.
#### Syntax
```javascript
scaleCropRotate.imageToImageData(object);
```
#### Parameters
##### object
An [`HTMLImageElement`] object to retrieve an [`ImageData`] from.
#### Return value
A [`Promise`] that resolves with an [`ImageData`].


### URLToImageData
Loads an image from the given URI and retrieves an [`ImageData`].
#### Syntax
```javascript
scaleCropRotate.URLToImageData(URIString);
```
#### Parameters
##### URIString
A [`DOMString`] containing the URI linking to the image to retrieve an [`ImageData`] from.
#### Return value
A [`Promise`] that resolves with an [`ImageData`].

You cannot directly manipulate the contents of an ArrayBuffer; instead, you create one of the typed array objects or a DataView object which represents the buffer in a specific format, and use that to read and write the contents of the buffer."

[`Blob`]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob "A Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data.

It allows you to associate handlers to an asynchronous action's eventual success or failure. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point in the future."
